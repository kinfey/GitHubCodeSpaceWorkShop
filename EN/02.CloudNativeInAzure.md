## **Create an application combining Azure Static Web App and Azure Function through GitHub Codespaces**

Azure Static Web Apps is a service that automatically generates a full-stack web app from a code repository and deploys it to Azure.

<img src="./EN/imgs/02/09.png"/>

Workflows for Azure Static Web Apps fit into a developer's everyday workflow. Build and deploy applications based on code changes.

When you create an Azure Static Web Apps resource, Azure interacts directly with GitHub or Azure DevOps to monitor the fork you choose. Every time you push a commit to a monitored branch or accept a pull request, a build is automatically run and your app and API are deployed to Azure.

Static web apps are typically generated using libraries and web frameworks such as Angular, React, Svelte, Vue, or Blazor that don't require server-side rendering. These apps include the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image assets that make up the application. For traditional web servers, these assets are served by a single server along with any required API endpoints.

When using static web applications, static assets are separated from traditional web servers and served by servers distributed around the world. This distribution allows files to be served faster since the files are physically closer to the end user. Additionally, API endpoints use a serverless architecture, eliminating the need to put together a full backend server.

**The main function**

Web hosting for static content like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images.

Integration API support provided by Azure Functions with the option to link existing Azure Functions applications using standard accounts.

Best-in-class GitHub and Azure DevOps integration, where repository changes trigger builds and deployments.

Globally distributed static content, bringing content closer to your users.

Free auto-renewable SSL certificate.

Custom domains provide branding customization for apps.

A seamless security model using a reverse proxy when calling the API, which does not require CORS to be configured.

The authentication provider integrates with Azure Active Directory, GitHub, and Twitter.

Customizable authorization role definition and assignment.

Backend routing rules, giving you full control over served content and routing.

The resulting interim version is backed by a pull request, providing a preview version of the site before publication.

The CLI supports creation of cloud resources through the Azure CLI and local development through the Azure Static Web Application CLI.

This exercise will combine the previously set environment and tasks to complete the following two tasks. If you have not completed it, please skip to the chapter to configure https://github.com/kinfey/GitHubCodeSpaceWorkShop/blob/main/02 .CloudNativeEnv.md

### **Task 1: Configure your swa cli**

1. We have configured the corresponding environment configuration before, but we need to confirm the version of our nodejs in 16.x, because we have chosen the nvm package for management, so here we can adjust the version of nodejs through nvm, through terminal input

```bash

nvm install v16.14.0

```

Verify that it is correct by node -v

<img src="./EN/imgs/02/10.png"/>

At this time you can verify through your terminal

2. Install your swa cli

```bash

npm install -g @azure/static-web-apps-cli


```

The version number can be verified by swa -v, thus completing the configuration of swa cli

### **Task 2: Modify the previous project**

Replace Pages/Index.razor in Blazor wasm project

```csharp

@page "/"
@using System.Web
@inject HttpClient _httpClient;

<PageTitle>Index</PageTitle>


<EditForm Model="@formModel" OnValidSubmit="SubmitForm">

    <input placeholder="Enter your picture URL" style="width:80%" @bind-value="@formModel.URL"   />

    <input style="width:40%" type="submit" value="Submit" />

</EditForm>

<p>Result : @responseText</p>


@code {


    private FormModel formModel { get; set; } = new FormModel();

    private string responseText { get; set; } = "";



    private class FormModel
    {
        public string? URL { get; set; }
    }

    private async Task SubmitForm()
    {
        await GetAIResponseAsync();
    }

    private async Task GetAIResponseAsync()
    {
        if(_httpClient.BaseAddress is not null)
        {
            var uriBuilder = new UriBuilder(_httpClient.BaseAddress);
            uriBuilder.Path = "/api/AIOnnxHttpTrigger";

            if(!string.IsNullOrEmpty(formModel.URL) && !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(formModel.URL))
            {
                var query = HttpUtility.ParseQueryString(uriBuilder.Query);

                query["img"] = formModel.URL;

                uriBuilder.Query = query.ToString();
            }

            var builtUri = uriBuilder.ToString();

            Console.WriteLine($"builtUri: {builtUri}");

            @* responseText = uriBuilder.ToString(); *@

            var response = await _httpClient.GetStringAsync(builtUri);

            responseText = response;
        }
    }
}

```
2. Add package.json in the apps folder, including the following content

```json

{
  "name": "swa-blazorandfunc-demo",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "swa start http://localhost:5074 --api-location http://localhost:7071"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "main": "index.js",
  "description": ""
}


```

3. In the terminal environment, add three different terminals

Run the Blazor wasm project in one terminal and the Azure Functions project in one terminal to make sure they run long term

<img src="./EN/imgs/02/11.png"/>

4. In the last terminal, run under the apps folder

```bash

npm start

```

<img src="./EN/imgs/02/12.png"/>


5. Open it in the browser and you can see it, copy the address, here is mine, everyone will be different

https://kinfey-turbo-yodel-wjpvpxg7xr7h9wr7-4280.preview.app.github.dev/

and replace in this sentence in Blazor wasm Program.cs

```bash

builder.Services.AddScoped(sp => new HttpClient { BaseAddress = new Uri("https://kinfey-turbo-yodel-wjpvpxg7xr7h9wr7-4280.preview.app.github.dev/") });

```

6. Run again, enter the address to get the result

<img src="./EN/imgs/02/13.png"/>

Of course, you can quickly deploy to Azure, so I won't show them one by one here.
